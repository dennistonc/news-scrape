# NYT News & Notes (News Scraper)

### Week 18 Homework
#### About This Homework

This web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news by using Mongoose and Cheerio to scrape news from another site.
<br />

#### How it Works
When the user clicks "Scrape Articles" the app scrapes stories from the New York Times and displays them for the user. Users are able to save articles of their choice, are able to leave comments on the articles displayed, revisit those articles/comments later, and view other comments that have been left on the article as well from other users.
